1. INTRODUCTION
===============

It is strongly recommended to install all required systems tools and utilities
in a directory with no embedded white spaces. You can skip some steps if you
already have the correct tools installed on your system.


2. INSTRUCTIONS FOR BUILDING ON WINDOWS
=======================================

1) Download and install 7-Zip (see reference list below). This is necessary to
   be able to unzip the rest of the required packages mentioned in later steps.

2) Download and install wget and MinGW-w64.

3) Download and install MSYS (see reference list below).

4) Obtain a copy of the CalculiX build script and patches directory:
       git clone https://github.com/GeneralElectric/CalculiX.git CalculiX

5) Open a new MSYS shell and chdir to the src directory:
       cd CalculiX/src

6) Edit the user-modifiable entries in etc/bashrc.mingw to point to the
   locations where you have installed the required system tools in the first two
   steps (the first two functions only in bashrc.mingw). The order in which they
   are added to the PATH (in the add_to_path function) is very important. The
   PATH is read from left to right, so ensure the MinGW-w64 compiler are
   prepended to the PATH, so they are found first.

7) Source the file edited in the previous step using the command:
       . etc/bashrc.mingw
   (notice the dot "." command to source a file). This action also performs
   a check on the versions of the installed system tools.
   An example output is shown at the end of this file.

8) If the version checks were all successful and printed the expected version
   details, proceed with compiling the code. Run the following command:
       ./build.sh 2.10 2.10
   This will download and build all required third-party dependencies, build
   CalculiX CCX and CGX, and create an install directory.

9) To test the CCX build, run the script:
       ./build.sh 2.10 2.10 test

10) To create a stand-alone binary .zip or .7z package, run the script:
       ./release.sh 2.10 2.10

11) After the build has completed, you can run CCX or CGX in either of two ways:
   (a). From the MSYS shell.
   (b). From a standard Windows CMD.exe command prompt using the created
        CalculiX-2.10-win-x64.zip or CalculiX-2.10-win-x64.7z stand-alone package.
        This can be used on any Windows machine without access to MSYS shells or compilers.
        See the READMEBinaryPackage.txt file in the generated package.


3. EXTERNAL PACKAGE REFERENCE
=============================

Name   : 7-Zip
Version: 9.20 (or above)
URL    : http://www.7-zip.org/a/7z920-x64.msi
For    : Extracting .zip and .7z files (can also be used to extract .tar.gz, .tar.bz2 etc.)

Name   : MinGW-w64
Version: 4.8.2 (or above)
URL    : http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/4.8.2/threads-win32/seh/x86_64-4.8.2-release-win32-seh-rt_v3-rev3.7z/download
For    : Windows port of GCC C/C++ compiler (also includes Fortran compiler).

Name   : MSYS
Version: Latest
URL    : http://www.mingw.org/download/installer
For    : Provides Linux-like emulation shell and utilities (eg. find, grep, ls, make etc.) and tools (eg. bison, flex, m4, yacc etc.).
         Only the "mingw-developer-toolkit" and "msys-base" is required, DO NOT download ming32-* compiler packages (we use MinGW-w64 instead).
         Assuming you installed this to the default /c/MinGW directory, you will need to "cp -p make.exe gmake.exe" in /c/MinGW/msys/1.0/bin (unless have Strawberry Perl).

Name   : wget
Version: 1.11.4-1 (or above)
URL    : http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gnuwin32/wget-1.11.4-1-bin.zip, http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gnuwin32/wget-1.11.4-1-dep.zip, http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gnuwin32/wget-1.11.4-1-doc.zip
For    : Automatically downloading files from internet (eg. for use in automated build scripts)
